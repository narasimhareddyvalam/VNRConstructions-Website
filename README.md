# Welcome to My Debut Website!
I have developed this website to reflect the core values and services of my construction business.
I have placed the title ‘VNR Constructions’ at the top of the page within the header
Following the title, I have included a navigation bar. 
Following the title and navigation bar, I have included a summary tag, within which I have detailed information about my company and the services we provide.
After that, I have included several photographs into my website. Each photograph is accompanied by a hyperlink that directs users to Wikipedia pages about the areas where I plan to develop my future apartment projects.
Following the photographs, I have included a table that provides additional information about my projects.
After that,  I have integrated both a video and an audio component.
Following to the audio and video components, I have included a form featuring a picklist and text input field, along with several headings to ensure a clean and professional appearance. Additionally, I have included a mailto hyperlink and a phone number hyperlink, which will direct the user to their respective mail or phone applications upon clicking.
I have concluded my webpage with a footer that includes several taglines of my company.
